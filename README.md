**Fig.1.** An illustration of the proposed unsupervised hyperspectral super-resolution networks, called Coupled Unmixing Nets with Cross-Attention **(CUCaNet)**, inspired by spectral unmixing techniques, which mainly consists of two important modules: cross-attention and spatial-spectral consistency.

## Training
#TODO with demo on two HSIs (*fake and real food* and *chart and staffed toy*) of the [CAVE dataset](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/multispectral).

## Testing
#TODO
